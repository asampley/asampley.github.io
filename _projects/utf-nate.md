My most maintained project by far.

A discord bot to play music, play sound clips to introduce you when you join a call, and
designed to be extended with shell scripts when you set it up, so it also gets used to start
and stop services used by the discord.

It began as a python bot that I modified, and ended up as a from scratch bot written in rust
to learn the language. It even supports multiple simultaneous instances to run with different
settings, as all user configuration is stored in a database that can be set up for concurrent
access.

Alas, there is no publicly viewable preview, as it was created and is maintained by me for our
specific server needs.
