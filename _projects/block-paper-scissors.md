One of my favorites for sure, you must get your mind around rolling cubes in this one, to land
with the right side up against your opponents (rock side beats scissors, of course).

It's a turn based strategy, and the amount of levels we were able to quickly arrange was
definitely an accomplishment, along with the mixed 2D/3D look.
