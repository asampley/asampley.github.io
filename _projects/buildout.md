BuildOut is our take on the classic game Breakout. Combining the classic ball bouncing gameplay with
the falling blocks of Tetris. The player builds their own paddle larger and larger with each level.
But watch out! You may run into trouble if you don't build with scaling in mind! Shoot for a high
score across 10 exciting levels!

Especially snapping pieces to the paddle, that's my hard work in action. Required a lot of trial and
error in a short time to keep that predictable, feasible, and looking good.
