A fishing game with a twist, you are the horror that drags the fishermen down to the briny
depths.

Really proud of the look of the tentacles in this one, giving them a very real feel in a
sprite based world. Definitely a lot we tried to fit in, that leaves it in an almost finished
game jam state, but dang if it isn't our prettiest to date.
