A puzzle concept that I want to develop further in the future, for sure.

You and a friend must navigate through the crystal caves, but there's a catch. You can walk,
or conversely fall through the crystals that match your color! Use this to get places your
friend can't, but most importantly, use the laser on your head, to change the places your
friend *can* get.

Based on the RGB color model, you can both add and subtract colors that you look at to
manipulate the world, in a way that only your friend will be able to take advantage of, whether
you make a new platform for them, or open a door.
