How's your rhythm, when you have to play three different instruments? Fight off three different
types of monsters, while switching to the instrument that fights them off. You can't neglect
any of the instruments, or it's game over.

Pretty proud of this one, but boy oh boy was it a race against the clock to map all those
instruments to the song before the time was up.
