    Some of my bigger personal projects that aren't games. These are the projects that actually get
    used by end users, for more or less time. The discord bot in particular sees use every single
    day.
Game Jams:

    Created in a couple of days by me and a few other people, they are small games, that just show a
    concept, really, and then are done. A great medium for brainstorming, and experimenting with
    mechanics, which is my favorite part.

    Try them out by clicking on their name, or download them and run it locally. 

    They are ordered newest to oldest, so check out some of the my newer work, right away, or scroll
    down to get to the really crunchy inexperienced games right off the bat.
Prototype Games:

    There's really only one of these, maybe there'll be more someday. But if you want the more serious
    foray into games with networking, large map design, and my favorite mechanic concept yet, this is
    the place!
