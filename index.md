Welcome!

I'm a programmer by trade, but I also love puzzles, an interesting piece of math, or a new
tidbit of physics. I graduated from the University of Alberta with a BSc in Computer Science, as
well as a Computer Game Development Certificate, and made it dangerously high up in physics so that
I think I know way more than I do.

I set this site up originally as a sort of advanced resume. But then I left it alone, and let's
face it, it looked kind of like crap. However, it had great utility if you wanted to check out some
of my old game jam games, and it still does! Check out my [portfolio] and try some out if that
sounds like fun. It also includes my non-game personal projects.

Now though, I've given it a new facelift so that I can start a [blog]. Sometimes I have a fun bit of
information, that I'd like to share, and although I often do verbally with friends and family, I've
decided it may be nice to put them to print and picture. Perhaps you will find some of them
interesting!

This site is designed to respect your browser's font settings, and scale up appropriately. The flow
is linearly defined to hopefully do well for screen readers. I'm far from an accessibility expert,
feel free to submit issues you encounter, and I will try to make it better!
