Behold, my projects!

Most of them are games, come have a little fun, with games that resemble flash games of old (in
various feelings of completion).

There's a few other projects here, too, they're probably less fun, unless you play factorio where
you might find my calculator handy (though it may be outdated). The discord bot is not really in
much of a public viewing state, but I'm very proud of it's functionality, it'll get more polished
and published. And take a peek into my mind with the one larger game prototype, which you'll need
a friend for, but I'm very proud of the concept. One day it will make it into a real game.
